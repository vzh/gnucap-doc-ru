=== Queues and OPT::bypass ===

To improve speed GNucap solver uses device queues, most queues are activated when OPT::bypass is set to true.

This section will create analysis  of how this is implemented.

== No bypass (OPT::bypass==false) ==

Looking at code of SIM::evaluate_models() - if (OPT::bypass==false) then
only _late_evalq queue is used.

  * first for all devices do_tr() is performed (no queues);
  * then - for devices in _late_evalq queue is executed method do_tr_last();


Same approach is used in TRANSIENT::sweep():

  * for all devices is executed do_tr()
  * for _late_evalq is executed do_tr_last()

_late_evalq itself is declared in u_sim_data.h

elements can be added to _late_evalq are:

  * d_cccs
  * d_ccvs
  * d_coil

== bypass (OPT::bypass==true) ==
