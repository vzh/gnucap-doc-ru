=== Noise Simulation Syntax ===

To run noise simulation - ad the following line to circuit file (spice format):

''.noise V(a,b) Dev stepmode points fromF toF''


  * V(a,b)  - output to measure noise at - nodes a to b; possible form:
V(a) is the same as V(a,0)
  * Dev    - device which is considered as input
  * stepmode - [o{ctave}, d{ecade}, lin, ti{mes}, step, by, +, *]
  * points - number of points (depends on stepmode)
  * fromF   - lowest frequency
  * toF     - highest frequency

It will calculate noise power density between output nodes "a" and "b" and equivalent power at input device "Dev" using "stepmode" making "points" in frequency range "fromF"-"toF"

Example:

'' .noise v(3) V1 oct 5 10 10K ''

 - calcualate spectral noise density at node "3" and reduce it to input device V1 making 5 points per octave in frequency range from 10HZ to 10KHZ

'' .noise V(10,12) I1 dec 2 10K 10MEG''

 - calcualate spectral noise density between nodes 10 and 12 and reduce it to input device I1 making 2 points per decade in frequency range from 10KHZ to 10MHZ


== Output ==


Usually simulators also support ''.print noise'' statement. Now it is not implemented yet.
Currently output contains:

'' Freq inoise_density onoise_density ''

Also - at the end of the frequency range total power over the range s integrated:

'' inoise_total onoise_total ''
