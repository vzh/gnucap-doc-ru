=== Programming Details ===

Topmost level solver computations are concentrated in s__solve.cc file in
<code c++> SIM::solve(...) </code>
inside it main important steps:
<code c++> do { </code>
assume we have some value of unknowns: X_c
calculate model parameters
<code c++>   evaluate models; </code>
load matrices (Jacobian J and vector FG)

note, that dumping is implemented duing matrix & vector loading process.
<code c++>   load_marix(); </code>
solve equations and obtan new poin X_n
<code c++>   solve_equations(); </code>
until equations will converge or iteration limit will not be acieved
<code c++>  } while ( ! converged && ! _sim-> exceeds_iteration_limit(it1));</code>
