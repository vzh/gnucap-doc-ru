**23.ASPICE**

Purpose:Start an asynchronous run and loads the data to specified output file.

Status:Implemented

Syntax:
      aspice input_file output_file



Comments:

input_file is a file which is to be run in batch mode and output_file corresponds to the file on which data will be loaded.If output_file already exists then the contents of the file are overwritten by the current output.



Example:

Suppose my script file contains an instruction to execute the version command.Then,command to get the output of the script into another file say, version.txt is

      gnucap>aspice script version.txt
      Gnucap
      Main version: 2009.12.07 RCS 26.136
      gnucap>

Now,version.txt contains the output of version command.
