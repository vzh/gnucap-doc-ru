=== Code related stuff ===

Currently noise simulation is implemented as plugin which is available at github at the following [[ https://github.com/gserdyuk/gnucap-plugins | link ]]

It re-uses s_ac.cc file (ac simulation) to implement noise analysis.

At the present moment (April 2011) noise works with only [[https://github.com/gserdyuk/gnucap-a | gnucap-a]] branch of gnucap, but hopefully soon it will work with main trunk too.

[TBD - make description of the noise code]
