====== "mean", "integrate", "rms" measures ======

===== Purpose =====

| mean      |Find the mean or average value of a waveform.  |
|integrate  |Find the integral of a waveform, the area under the curve.  |
|rms        |Find the RMS (root mean square) value of a waveform.  |

===== Syntax =====

  mean(probe="p(d)"  begin=time  end=time)
  integrate(probe="p(d)"  begin=time  end=time)
  rms(probe="p(d)"  begin=time  end=time)

===== Parameters =====

^arg name  ^default  ^description  ^
|probe     |required    |The name of a probe to measure.  |
|begin     |- infinity  |Start averaging at this time or frequency.  |
|end       |+ infinity  |Stop averaging at this time or frequency.  |

===== Comments =====

The "mean" measure gives you the true average or mean value.  The mean value of a sine over a full cycle is zero.

The "integrate" measure gives you the integral, or area under the curve, signed.  The integral of a sine over a full cycle is zero.

The "rms" measure gives you the RMS (root mean square) value.

===== Examples =====

  measure sample = mean(probe="v(out)" begin=4u end=6u)
Find the mean value of v(out) between 4 microseconds and 6 microseconds.
  measure sample = mean(probe="v(out)")
Find the mean value of v(out) for an entire run.
  measure sample = mean(probe="v(out)" begin=4u)
Find the mean value of v(out) starting at 4 microseconds, to the end.

  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)" begin=4u end=6u)
Find the area under the curve of v(out) between 4 microseconds and 6 microseconds.
  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)")
Find the area under of v(out) for an entire run.
  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)" begin=4u)
Find the area under of v(out) starting at 4 microseconds, to the end.
