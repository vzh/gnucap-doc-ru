====== "min", "max" measure ======

===== Purpose =====

Find the time or frequency where a probed value hits a maximum or minimum.

===== Syntax =====

  min(probe="p(d)" begin=time end=time last first arg)

===== Parameters =====

^arg name  ^default    ^description  ^
|probe     |required   |The name of a probe to measure.  |
|arg       |false      |Find the time or frequency at which the min or max occurs. (instead of the value)  |
|begin     |-infinity  |The window begins at this time or frequency.  |
|end       |+infinity  |The window ends at this time or frequency.  |
|first     |true       |Find the first min or max in the window.  (Cancels last.)  |
|last      |false      |Find the last min or max in the window.  (Cancels first.)  |

===== Examples =====

  measure maxvalue = max(probe="v(out)" cross=0 last)
Find the maximum value of v(out).
  measure t2 = max(probe="v(out)" last arg)
Find the last time when a maximum occurred.
  measure t1 = max(probe="v(out)" arg last before=t2)
Find the last time when a maximum occurred before t2.
  param period = {t2-t1}
  param frequency = {1/period}
Params are interpreted like a functional language so they will be updated whenever t1 or t2 changes.
  measure t0 = min(probe="v(out)" arg last before=t2)
Find the last time when a minimum occurred before t2.
  param risetime = {t2-t0}
