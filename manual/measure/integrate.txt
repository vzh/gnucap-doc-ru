====== "integrate" measure ======

===== Purpose =====

Find the integral of a waveform, the area under the curve.

===== Syntax =====

  integrate(probe="p(d)"  begin=time  end=time)

===== Parameters =====

^arg name  ^default     ^description  ^
|probe     |required    |The name of a probe to measure.  |
|begin     |- infinity  |Start averaging at this time or frequency.  |
|end       |+ infinity  |Stop averaging at this time or frequency.  |

===== Comments =====

This measure gives you the integral, or area under the curve, signed.  The integral of a sine over a full cycle is zero.

===== Examples =====

  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)" begin=4u end=6u)
Find the mean value of v(out) between 4 microseconds and 6 microseconds.
  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)")
Find the mean value of v(out) for an entire run.
  measure sample = integrate(probe="v(out)" begin=4u)
Find the mean value of v(out) starting at 4 microseconds, to the end.
