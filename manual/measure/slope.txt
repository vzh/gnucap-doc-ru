====== "slope" measure ======

===== Purpose =====

Find the slope or slew rate of a waveform.

===== Syntax =====

  slope(probe="p(d)" initial=value final=value begin=time end=time expression)

===== Parameters =====

^arg name    ^default  ^description  ^
|probe       |required   |The name of a probe to measure.  |
|initial     |0          |The initial value.  |
|final       |0          |The final value.  |
|begin       |-infinity  |The window begins at this time or frequency.  |
|end         |+infinity  |The window ends at this time or frequency.  |
|first       |true       |Find the first crossing in the window.  (Cancels last.)  |
|last        |false      |Find the last crossing in the window.  (Cancels first.)  |
|expression  |false      |The result is an unreduced expression.  |

===== Comments =====

Ordinarily, the result is a number.  If the probe is a voltage probe the units would be volts per second.

If the "expression" keyword is given the result is an unreduced expression.

===== Examples =====

  measure sr = slope(probe="v(out)" initial=-2 final=2 last)
Find the slope (slew rate) for the last transition from -2 to 2, as a number.
  sr= 30.15738K

  measure sr = slope(probe="v(out)" initial=-2 final=2 last expression)
Find the slope (slew rate) for the last transition from -2 to 2, as an unreduced expression.
  sr={( 2.--2.)/( 0.001066319- 933.6812u)}
