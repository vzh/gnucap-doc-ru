====== "save" command ======

===== Purpose =====

Saves the circuit to a file.

===== Syntax =====

  save filename {options ...}

===== Comments =====

The file is in an ASCII format, so the list may be used as part of a report.

The format used depends on the "language" option, which could use a plugin to provide any format.  "Spice", "Spectre" and "Verilog" formats are supported in the standard installation.

You can save a part of a circuit. See the list command for more details.

===== Examples =====

  save works.ckt
Save the circuit in the file works.ckt, in the current directory.
  save
Save the circuit. Since you did not specify a file name, it will ask for one.
  save partof.ckt R*
Save a partial circuit, just the resistors, to the file partof.ckt. (See the List command.)
  save /client/sim/ckt/no33
You can specify a path name.
