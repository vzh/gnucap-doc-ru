====== "sweep" command ======

===== Purpose =====

Sweep a component (or group of components) over a range. Set up a loop for iteration.

===== Syntax =====

  sweep {stepcount} partlabel=range ...

===== Comments =====

This command is considered obsolete, but the replacement is not working yet.

This command begins a loop which will sweep a component or group of components.

When this command is given, the only apparent actions will be a change in the prompt from `gnucap>' to `>>>', and some disk action.

The different prompt means that commands are not executed immediately, but are stored in a temporary file.

The bare command will repeat the same command sequence as the last time sweep was run, and not prompt for anything else.

Additional components can be swept at the same time by entering a `FAult' command at the `>>>' prompt. The `fault' behaves differently here: It accepts a range, which is the sweep limits.

The `go' command will end the entry sequence, and make it all happen. After this, the values are restored. (Also, all faults are restored, as if by the `restore' command.)

All commands can be used in this mode. Of course, some of them are not really useful (quit) because they work as usual.

Only linear, ordinary parts can be swept. (No semiconductor devices, or elements using behavioral modeling.) The tolerance remains unchanged. If you attempt to sweep a nonlinear or otherwise strange part, it becomes ordinary and linear during the sweep.

===== Example =====

  gnucap> sweep  5   R14=1,100k   R15=100k,1
  >>>list
  >>>ac 500 2k oct
  >>>go
This sequence of commands says to simultaneously sweep R14 and R15 in 5 steps, in opposite directions, list the circuit and do an AC analysis for each step.

Assuming the circuit was:
  R14  1   0   50k
  R15  2   0   50k
The result of this sequence would be:
  R14  1   0   1
  R15  2   0   100k
an AC analysis
  R14  1   0   25.75k
  R15  2   0   75.25k
an AC analysis
  R14  1   0   50.5k
  R15  2   0   50.5k
an AC analysis
  R14  1   0   75.25k
  R15  2   0   25.75k
an AC analysis
  R14  1   0   100k
  R15  2   0   1
an AC analysis

After all this is done, the circuit is restored, so list would show:
  R14  1   0   50k
  R15  2   0   50k

You could accomplish the same thing by entering fault commands at the `>>>' prompt.
  gnucap>sweep  5
  >>>fault  R14=1, 100k
  >>>fault  R15=100k, 1
  >>>list
  >>>ac 500 2k oct
  >>>go
