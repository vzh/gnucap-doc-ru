====== "title" command ======

===== Purpose =====

View and create the heading line for printouts and files.

===== Syntax =====

  title
  title a line of text

===== Comments =====

There is a header line at the beginning of every file, to help you identify it in the future. This command sets up what it says. It also sets up a heading for printouts and graphs.

When you use the `get' command to bring in a new circuit, it replaces the title with the one in the file. The `title' command lets you change it, for the next time it is written out.

===== Examples =====

  title This is a test.
Sets the file heading to `This is a test.' In the future, all files written will have `This is a test.' as their first line.
  title
Displays the file heading. In this case, it prints `This is a test.'
