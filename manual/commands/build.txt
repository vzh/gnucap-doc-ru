====== "build" command ======

===== Purpose =====

Builds a new circuit, with Spice syntax.

===== Syntax =====

  build

===== Comments =====

"Build" lets you enter the circuit from the keyboard. The prompt changes to > to show that the program is in the build mode.

At this point, type in the circuit components in Spice netlist format.

Component labels must be unique. If not, the old one is modified according to the new data, keeping old values where no new ones were specified.

Components are added to the end of the list.

Components being changed or replaced do not change their location in the list.

If it is necessary to start over, "delete all" or "clear" will erase the entire circuit in memory.

To exit this mode, enter a blank line.

This command is deprecated, and may be removed in a future release.  You can use the command "spice" instead.
