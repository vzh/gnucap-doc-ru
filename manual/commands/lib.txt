====== "lib" command ======

===== Purpose =====

Selective "library" include, and mark sections of a library.

===== Syntax =====

  lib section-name
  lib file-name section-name

===== Comments =====

This command takes two forms:

The first form is to mark a section of a file, with a name, so it can be selectively included.  The section ends with a line ".endl".

  .lib high
  R1 (1 2) 10k
  R2 (2 0) 10k
  .endl
  .lib low
  R1 (1 2) 1k
  R2 (2 0) 1k
  .endl

The second form has two arguments.  It is a special case of "include", that only includes matching sections of the file.

  .lib libfile high
