====== "poly" Polynomial nonlinear transfer function ======

===== Syntax =====

  poly  c0 c1 c2 c3 ...
  poly  c0 c1 c2 c3 ... args

===== Purpose =====

Defines a transfer function by a one dimensional polynomial.

===== Comments =====

For capacitors, this function defines //charge// as a function of
voltage.  For inductors, it defines //flux// as a function of
current.  If you have the coefficients defining capacitance or
inductance, prepending a "0" to the list will turn it into the
correct form for Gnucap.

For fixed sources, it defines voltage or current as a polynomial
function of time.

The transfer function is defined by:

  out = c0 + (c1*in) + (c2*in^2) + ....

===== Parameters =====

|min  |Minimum output value (clipping).  (Default = -infinity)  |
|max  |Maximum output value (clipping).  (Default = infinity)  |
|abs  |Absolute value, truth value.  (Default = false).  If set to true, the result will be always positive.  |

===== Step control =====

This function does not directly participate in time step control, except as the device would otherwise.
