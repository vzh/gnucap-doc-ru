====== "generator" Signal Generator time dependent value ======

===== Syntax =====

  generator  scale

===== Purpose =====

The component "value" is dependent on a "signal generator",
manipulated by the "generator" command.

===== Comments =====

For transient analysis, the "value" is determined by a signal
generator, which is considered to be external to the circuit and part
of the test bench.  See the "generator" command for more
information.

For AC analysis, the value here is the amplitude.

Strictly, all of the functionality and more is available through the
Spice-like behavioral modeling functions, but this one provides a user
interface closer to the function generator that an analog designer
would use on a real bench.  It is mainly used for interactive operation.

It also provides backward compatibility with predecessors to Gnucap,
which used a different netlist format.
