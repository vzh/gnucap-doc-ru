====== "complex" Complex value ======

===== Syntax =====

  complex ( realpart imaginarypart options )

===== Purpose =====

Complex component value, using a real and imaginary part.  AC only.

===== Comments =====

Strictly, this adds no functionality over the polar option on any
function, except notational convenience.

It is only meaningful in AC analysis.  Others take the real part and
ignore the imaginary part.  No warning is issued.
===== Step control =====

This function does have any role in time step control.  The notion of complex values does not work in transient analysis.

===== Example =====

  V12 (2 0) complex(1,2)
A voltage source with a value of 1 + j2 volts.

  R12 (2 4) complex(50,-10)
A "resistor" with a value of 50 - j10 ohms.
