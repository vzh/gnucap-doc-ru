====== "tanh" Hyperbolic tangent transfer function ======

===== Syntax =====

  tanh gain limit
  tanh args

===== Purpose =====

Defines a hyperbolic tangent, or soft limiting, transfer function.

===== Comments =====

There is no corresponding capability in any SPICE that I know of, but
you can get close with POLY.

For capacitors, this function defines //charge// as a function of
voltage.  For inductors, it defines //flux// as a function of
current.

For fixed sources, it defines voltage or current as a function of
time, which is probably not useful.

This function describes a hyperbolic tangent transfer function similar
to what you get with a single stage push-pull amplifier, or a simple
CMOS inverter acting as an amplifier.
===== Parameters =====

|gain   |The small signal gain at 0 bias.  (Required)  |
|limit  |Maximum output value (soft clipping).  (Required)  |

===== Step control =====

This function does not directly participate in time step control, except as the device would otherwise.  This is considered to be a deficiency, and may be addressed in the future.

===== Example =====

  E1 (2 0 1 0) tanh gain=-10 limit=2 ioffset=2.5 ooffset=2.5
This gain block has a small signal gain of -10.  The input is
centered around 2.5 volts.  The output is also centered at 2.5 volts.
It "clips" softly at 2 volts above and below the output center, or
at .5 volts (2.5 - 2) and 4.5 volts (2.5 + 2).
