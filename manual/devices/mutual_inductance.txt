====== Coupled (Mutual) Inductors ======

===== Syntax =====

  Kxxxxxxx Lyyyyyyy Lzzzzzzz value

===== Purpose =====

Coupled mutual inductance.

===== Comments =====

K couples two inductors.  The value is the coefficient of coupling.  Using the dot convention, place a dot on the first node of each inductor.

The coefficient of coupling is given by K = m[i][j] / sqrt(L[i] L[j]).  K is always positive and less than 1.

===== Bugs =====

This version of mutual inductance is only supported in Spice syntax, because the connections are inductors.  If you are using any other syntax, you can make a Spice subcircuit containing the entire transformer.
