====== About Gnucap ======

Gnucap is a modern "post-spice" analog and mixed signal circuit simulator.

Gnucap is designed so it can eventually replace Spice.  Today, it can replace Spice in some applications.  There are some significant technical advantages.  It is a work in progress.  New features are added regularly as time and demand permits.

    * true mixed-mode engine, analog events, the essence of modern "fast-spice" simulators.
    * Improved speed with full Spice accuracy.
    * Improved accuracy through rigorous error control.
    * User control of speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs.
  * Fully interactive operation with scripting.
  * Parameters, measures.
  * Multiple simulation languages, including Spice, Verilog, and Spectre.  More are coming!
